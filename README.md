# windows-powershell-autoconfig

## What is it?

It is a *NodeJS* Project which updates your **powershell** and **oh-my-posh** scripts. 

## Why should I use it?

It is very convenient if:
- you work on more than one computer
- your computer lost the data on the main drive
- you bought/built a new computer

## Make sure:

- that you installed **oh-my-posh**!
  - Here the original docs: https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/
- that you installed **powershell** !**WARNING:** NOT WINDOWS POWERSHELL!
  - Here the original install guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell

## How can I set it up for myself?

### 1. Run the Code

Follow these steps:

- clone the repo
- change the powershell config with your preferences
- type in `npm i` to install all dependencies
- type in `npm run initialize` to initialize your shell config


### 2. Future setup

**Fork it!** I am working on a *feature* to check the current repo for changes. If the **config-file** changes, your config will be updated!


**Feel free to contribute!**
